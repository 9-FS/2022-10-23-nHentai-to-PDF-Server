## 1. General

This is the nHentai downloader I wrote to archive as much of the [english nHentai library](https://nhentai.net/language/english/popular) as I can. This server version builds upon the original [nhentai to PDF downloader](https://github.com/9-FS/2021-11-15-nHentai-to-PDF) and automates searching by `nhentai_tag`, creating a `downloadme.txt` from that, downloading the hentai, and finally repeating the process all over again. It basically syncs part of the nhentai library to the local directory at `library_path`.  
Big thanks go out to [h3nTa1m4st3r_xx69](https://github.com/sam-k0), who helped me using nhentai's completely undocumented API. Without him this project could not have been reactivated.  
I'm happy about anyone who finds my software useful and feedback is also always welcome. Happy downloading~
